Changes between 1.0 and 2.0:
----------------------------
  * Support for directory input/output, where the stream is stored into
    "chunks" of fixed duration, accompanied with their auxiliary file
  * Support for TCP sockets in multicat, aggregartp and reordertp (/tcp)
  * Merge OffseTS functionality into multicat itself (-k and -d)
  * New program multicat_validate to validate directory inputs
  * New program lasts to determine the duration of an aux file
  * Support for IPv6
  * Add DVBlast-style options for host parsing (ifindex, ifaddr, ttl and tos)
  * Add the ability to output a stream as fast as possible (-f)
  * Renamed desaggregartp to reordeRTP
  * Support for packet retransmission between aggregaRTP and reordeRTP
  * Use biTStream instead of internal parsing functions
  * Removed limits on number of inputs/outputs in aggregaRTP and reordeRTP
  * Finer jitter control in reordeRTP
  * Fix timestamping error in ingesTS with streams where the first packet
    doesn't hold a PCR (re-ingest all existing streams)
  * Fix miscellaneous bugs
