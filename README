Welcome to Multicat!

The multicat package contains a set of tools designed to easily and
efficiently manipulate multicast streams in general, and MPEG-2
Transport Streams (ISO/IEC 13818-1) in particular.

The multicat tool itself is a 1 input/1 output application. Inputs and
outputs can be network streams (unicast and multicast), files, character
devices or FIFOs.

Multicat tries to rebuild the internal clock of the input stream; but
it wants to remain agnostic of what is transported, so in case of files
the said clock is stored to an auxiliary file (example.aux accompanies
example.ts) while recording. Other inputs are considered "live", and
the input clock is simply derived from the reception time of the packets.

IngesTS is a companion application designed to manipulate TS files. It
reads the PCR values of the file, and builds the auxiliary file that is
necessary for multicat.

OffseTS is another companion application to manipulate auxiliary files.
Given an offset in time from the beginning of the file, it returns the offset
of the position in number of packets.

Finally aggregaRTP and desaggregaRTP can be used to carry a high-bitrate
signal over several contribution links.

The multicat suite of applications is very lightweight and designed to
operate in tight environments. Memory and CPU usages are kept to a minimum,
and they feature only one thread of execution. They have no dependancy.
