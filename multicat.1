.SH DESCRIPTION
Multicat is a 1 input/1 output application. Inputs and outputs can be network
streams (unicast and multicast, IPv4 and IPv6), files, directories, character devices or FIFOs. It is thought
to be a multicast equivalent of the popular netcat tool.

Multicat tries to rebuild the internal clock of the input stream; but it wants
to remain agnostic of what is transported, so in case of files and directories, the said clock
is stored to an auxiliary file (example.aux accompanies example.ts) while
recording. Other inputs are considered "live", and the input clock is simply
derived from the reception time of the packets.
